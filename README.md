# RossWe3Dev

I'm a self taught web developer currently honing my skills through The Odin Project. Building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is my initial focus. I'm also expanding my knowledge with Ruby on Rails to create dynamic web applications.
Beyond web development, I have an interest in data analysis.
In the future, I wish to create a unique TTRPG-style game, combining my web development skills with my passion for D&D.
