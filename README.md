# RossWe3Dev

- I'm a self-taught programmer honing my skills through The Odin Project.
- My initial focus is building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I'm currently going through the Ruby on Rails curriculum to expand my knowledge and create dynamic web applications.
- Beyond web development, I have a keen interest in data analysis.
- In the future, I dream of creating a unique TTRPG-style game, combining my web development skills with my passion for D&D.
